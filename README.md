# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
Pyber, a ridesharing service, would like to gain insight into the current state of its business. Using data on both individual Pyber rides as well as Pyber rides being used in each city, we can perform analysis on the number of rides, number of drivers, prices of Pyber rides, and more as a whole. 

Beyond doing an analysis of all aggregated Pyber data, we can further gain insight into how the type of city, whether urban, suburban, or rural, may affect the use of Pyber as well as other measures such as number of drivers and ride price.
